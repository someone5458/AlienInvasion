# AlienInvasion
Alien Invasion is a 2D space shooter game built using Pygame. Inspired by Eric Matthes’ book “Python Crash Course”, this project began as a learning exercise but has since evolved into a more advanced and personalized game with many new mechanics and systems.
Your mission: survive waves of alien ships, dodge enemy bullets, and beat your high score.
